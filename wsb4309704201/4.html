Some examples of DeRisk's recent work:</span>
&nbsp; <br><br><span style="color:rgb(105, 105, 105);"><em><strong>Region: Southern Africa<br>
Business: SilverStreet Capital<br>
Funds raised: USD 350m</strong></em><br>
<br>
The UK and Luxembourg-based private equity fund manager, SilverStreet Capital, established the Silverlands Fund to invest in
 agricultural business in Southern Africa. SilverStreet raised USD 350m from international limited partners and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Given the fund's focus on agribusiness in Africa, SilverStreet investors were keen to ensure that the funds investments were protected against harmful government actions. </span><font color="#696969">DeRisk worked with both OPIC and MIGA to put in place a master contract of political risk insurance for SilverStreet Capital. The master contract is an innovative insurance contract that locks in OPIC and MIGA insurance capacity and pricing to cover future investments by the fund. OPIC will insure 40% of each investment, while MIGA will reinsure 60%.</font><div><br></div><font color="#696969">The Silverlands Fund plans to reach 500,000 small farmers over the next 10 years, leading to an estimated increase in total food production of over 1 million tons per year. The fund aims to accomplish this by investing across the agricultural value chain in sub-Saharan Africa in a variety of segments, including fruit, grains, soya, sugar, poultry, and livestock.&nbsp;</font><br>

<em style="color:rgb(105, 105, 105);"><strong>Country: Ghana<br>
Business: Takoradi Renewable Energy Ltd (TREL)<br>
Funds raised: USD 9m</strong></em><br>
<br><font color="#696969">
The UK/Belgium renewable energy firm, Africa Renewables (AfriRen), 
established a biomass extraction and processing business in Ghana to 
supply power plants with sustainable sources of biomass. USD 9m in both 
external debt finance and shareholder funds were required for the first 
phase of expansion. Investors considered MIGA coverage – and 
particularly its detailed due diligence process – to be an important 
safeguard as it looks to expand operations across West Africa. DeRisk 
worked with AfriRen and TREL to cover the entire investment amount with 
MIGA insurance. AfriRen is currently working to expand the business in 
Ghana and elsewhere in West Africa.</font><br>
